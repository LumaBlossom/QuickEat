## ✨ Features

- **One-Key Eating**: Press its dedicated keybind (default **G**) to instantly find and consume the best food in your inventory.
- **Sorting**:
  - **Saturation Mode**: Prioritizes food that keeps you full longer (e.g., Golden Carrots).
  - **Hunger Mode**: Prioritizes food that restores the most hunger points (e.g., Steak).
- **Eat until full**: Automatically eats until your hunger bar is full.
- **Inventory Grabbing**: Automatically pulls food from your main inventory if your hotbar is empty.
- **Anti-Cheat Mode**: Simulates human behavior with customizable delays and "stop" durations to keep you safe on servers.
